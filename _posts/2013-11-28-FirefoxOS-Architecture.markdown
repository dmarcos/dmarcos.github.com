The fertility of the Linux kernel fascinates me. Servers, super computers, embedded systems, desktop and more recently mobile devices. My knowledge is not deep enough to analyze the whys of its merits but oh boy I dream every day to create software that its at least 1 millionth as influential. It's not until recently that I started to care more about the bigger picture of software development. I don't want to stop developing. I need to find the motivations that are going make me stick to the craft for the next decade. The developers I admire and kept developing passed the late thirties are those that were able to move to the next level.

Linus Torvalds, John Carmack,

 They produce less and less disposable code and the lines they produce are immensely fertile outliving the immidiate needs of a project or the project itself where it was created

We stand on shoulders of giants and we should honor them understanding the design and beauty of those exceptional. The whys. the struggles and the compromises.

It's painful to be writting software that you know it's going to be disposable.

For me the natural evolution of a developer is to create software that's better designed, it's more reusable and survives the proof of time. I cannot see bigger satisfaction for a developer that a piece of software that outlives the immidiate needs of a project or even better the project itself for waht it was created. It's like proudly looking at the kids of your kids. What was once a fragile idea in your head it's now strong, grown up and

How a piece of software has been able I always fantasize with the idea of being the author of an piece of software.

My knowledge of Linux is not deep enough to properly judge the merits and
